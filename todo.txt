1. Add NLog.
2. Figure out how to get the Socket.IO streams from cryptocompare so we can have up to date prices and stop the per-minute poll for pricing data.
3. Make sure exchange has enough volume of the trackback coins at market price to trade for.
4. Seems like occasionally when attempting to find the best trackback, we're not finding an optimal route and the last one is being used somehow.
5. Move thread collection to application level. Kill threads as application closes.
