1. Make sure funds are moved to the exchange where we can buy the most trackback coin for out primary coin at the beginning.
2. Make sure pricing threads are actually updating the the pricing dictionary.
3. Add NLog.
4. Make sure exchange has enough volume of the trackback coins at market price to trade for.
